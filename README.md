# Warmup-Exercise-CSE110

## Overview
Our team, the LeCoders, decided that we wanted to attempt two different exercises.
We decided on the task list and the calendar to tackle a variety of challenges to see how our team works and coordinated with eachother. The overall plan was to split into smaller subteams where we split the group of 9 into 4 people working on the task list, and the other 5 working on the calendar. We made this split based on availability of each person as well as relative complexity of the task at hand. Throughout this process, we did realise that there was a lack of communication between teams working on different features. In general, we wanted to experiment how the dynamic would be when delegating smaller features to a subgroup of our team.
